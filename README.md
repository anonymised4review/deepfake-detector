# Deepfake-detector
Code of our submission "Detecting music deepfakes is easy but actually hard".

Most of our experiment code is available for the review.
We will publish the trained weights afterward, as well as more examples and interfaces to visualise the results better. 

The FMA dataset is available at [github.com/mdeff/fma](https://github.com/mdeff/fma).
We might publish our auto-encoded version of the dataset depending on the proper licensing requirement.
